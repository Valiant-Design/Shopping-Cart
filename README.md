# Shopping Cart Checkout System

## Overview
This project implements a simple checkout system for a shop that sells apples and oranges. The system allows users to select the quantity of apples and oranges they wish to purchase, with special offers applied automatically. The offers include "Buy one, get one free" on apples and "buy 3 oranges and pay for the price of 2".

## Technical Choices
- **HTML:** Used for structuring the webpage and defining the elements such as inputs and buttons.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the webpage to improve the user interface and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** Used for implementing the logic of the checkout system, including calculating the total cost based on the selected quantities and applying the special offers.

## Trade-offs
- **User Interface:** The focus of this project was on the functionality of the checkout system rather than the design of the user interface. More time could be spent on improving the visual appearance and usability of the interface.
- **Code Optimization:** The code could be further optimized for performance and readability, especially in the calculation logic and event handling.

## Future Improvements
- **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input or the calculation fails.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Add features such as a shopping cart summary, real-time updates of the total cost as the user selects quantities, and the ability to remove items from the cart.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the quantity of apples and oranges you wish to purchase.
3. Click the "Calculate Total" button to see the total cost with the applied offers.
